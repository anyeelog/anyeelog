Hi, Iâ€™m Angie and I am a recent graduate from Le Wagon coding bootcamp. 

I am passionate about coding. I have experience working on various projects using different programming languages such as Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, Javascript and SQL. 

In addition to coding, I am also a graphic designer. I believe in continuous learning and always strive to improve my skills.

In my free time, I enjoy gardening and taking care of my pets.
